# Machine Learning Learning Path With Beginer Projects.

This document combines a structured 30-day learning plan to help you build your machine learning skills.



## Progress Tracking
Create a progress tracking spreadsheet with:
- Daily learning objectives
- Completion status
- Challenges faced
- Solutions implemented
- Time spent on each activity

This structured approach will help you build both theoretical knowledge and practical skills while creating a portfolio of projects on GitHub that demonstrates your machine learning capabilities.
